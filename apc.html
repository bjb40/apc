<p>Both classic and modern social theory have proposed different effects across three social dimensions of time: age, period, and cohort <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ryder_cohort_1965"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. These dimensions of time operate on individuals in different ways as they flow through social space. Age effects are driven either by the common experiences associated with the biological process of aging <code>citation</code>, or persistent age-structuring institutions, like high school or retirement <code>life course citation</code>. Period effects are responses of everyone to contemporaneous social experiences, like recessions or wars <code>citation</code>. Finally, cohort effects are socialization effects. They are broad-based historical events that stick to the populations experiencing them. The great depression undoubtadly produced a period effect, but cohorts who experienced the great depression took it with them; they were qualitatively different than other cohorts for the rest of their lives. Cohorts are virtually always defined in terms of birth year.</p>
<p>These three dimensions of time sit at the center of some recurrent debates. Cultural sociologists are divided over whether the main driver of culture is a period process (cultural fragmentation) or a cohort process (acquired dispositions) [vaisey_cultural_2016]. <code>find a couple of health things, etc</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not trivial to estimate the unique effects of age, period, and cohort to find evidence that may settle these debates. The fundamental problem is one of identification: these three dimensions are linearly dependent. Two of the dimensions define the third. If a researcher knows an individual’s age, and the year of the survey, cohort is also defined. Because these variables are exactly colinear, they are not estimable using classic statistical techniques. A number of solutions have been proposed to address this conundrum, these include: ….</p>
<p>The past several years have seen a resurgence in debates surrounding these issues. The thrust of the methods outlined above is to find <em>the</em> best-fitting model. In reality, modeling constraints introduce assumptions that can produce drastically different, and these assumptions are often not apparent. This is similar to situations with high multicolinearity (say in the case of income and education), where inclusion of both variables in the model often produces results that are difficult to interperet <code>see if you can find something better than the stat blog on this</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on finding the <em>best</em> fitting model, as complicated as that may be, we fall back to a well-known strategy, window (or block) constraints. These models make a set of simple and straightforward assumptions that, if true, moot the identification problem. In particular, they assume that <em>some</em> of the unique ages, periods, and cohorts have identical effects. This equality blocks the age, period, or cohort together, and breaks the exact APC identity. The major criticism of these models is that a constraint in one of the variables induces unkown (and difficult to test constraints) in the other estimators []. Instead of relying on an arbitrrary set of constraints, our averages over thousands of constraints, weighted by an approximation to the probability of the model <code>terminology</code> using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) algorithms.</p>

<p><code>intro on piecewise constant functions</code></p>
<p>In terms of window constraints, the target model, which is inestimable, is built by estimating each unique value of age, period, and cohort, as a dummy variable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(Y) = \beta_{00} + \sum_{\lambda=2}^{\lambda} \beta_{1\lambda}A_{\lambda} +  \sum_{\rho=2}^{\rho} \beta_{2\rho}P_{\rho} +  \sum_{\kappa=2}^{\kappa} \beta_{3\kappa}C_{\kappa}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is an estimated effect, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> index unique values for age, period, and cohort, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> stand for matricies of dummy variable series for age, period, and cohort. This model is unidentified, because, as with the continuous case, the dummy variables in any two of the matricies above condition the third matrix. In other words, the indicator variable in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a function of the indicators in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (in mathematical terms,the probability that any given cohort dummy variable is one or zero is exctly dependent on the values of A and P, so that <span class="math inline">\(p(C_{\kappa}=0|A_{\lambda},P_{\kappa}\)</span>) is either exaclty zero, or exactly one).</p>
<p>This dependency is broken, however, by combining one or more of the unique values together so that they share the same dummy variable series. By way of example, we can construct an age dummy variable series where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is sliced into two groups based on some cut-point, say <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, so that …</p>
<p><code>work here</code></p>
<p>This would identify a binary dummy variable with an older and a younger group. We can generalize this expression to an arbitrary vector of cut-points, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with subscript <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> so that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mbox{for} \gamma &lt; max(\gamma):
A_{\lambda}  =
\begin{cases}
  1, &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; a &gt; G_{\gamma} &amp; \mbox{and} &amp; a \leq G_{\gamma+1} \\
  0, &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; a &lt; G_{\gamma} &amp; \mbox{or} &amp; a &gt; G_{\gamma+1}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>If the vector <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> have the following properties: <span class="math inline">\(max(G) = max(a)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(min(G) &lt; min(a)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \in \{1,2, ... {\gamma-1}\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&gt;2\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can describe any posible sets of window restrictions for age. Generalizing cross all dimensions of APC, permuting three similar vectors (say <span class="math inline">\(G^{(d)}\)</span>) will describe any model for any possible window constraints detailed in equation 1. Accordingly, all permutations of G, as defined above, constitute the model space of window constraints (<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{M}\)</span>). For any given set of data, <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{M}\)</span> is finite, but it can be quite large. For example, 10 unique ages, periods, and cohorts present <code>__</code> possible models. <code>describe how</code> Of these<code>__</code> models, only 1 is not estimable because of perfect colinearity. This target model is (theoretially) the least biased, although it is not the most parsimonious model. The question is how to best use infromation from some subset fo possible models in <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{M}\)</span> to estimate unbiased APC effects. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) provides a straightforward way to combine models. The theoretical backdrop applies to this curcumstance quite well. In principal, there is no one true (or best) model; instead estimates are conditional on models from the modeling space (<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{M}\)</span>), and have a posterior distribution, which is calculated as a weighted average of all models <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rafferty_1995"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. It has been applied in diverse areas from weather forecasting to biology to social science <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="fragaso_bayesian_2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> .</p>
<h2 id="bayesian-model-averaging-bma-and-the-mc3-algorithm">Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and the MC3 Algorithm</h2>
<p>Markov Chain methods for Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) provides a sensible way to sample over a subset of continually better-fitting models and combine their estimates to produce an approximation of APC effects. The next two sections describe the MC3 agorithm developed for BMA, and outline the unique implementation of MC3 for this particular set of models, drawing from the Dirichelet distribution.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-dirichlet-distribution-to-sample-window-groups-g">Using the Dirichlet Distribution to Sample Window Groups (G)</h2>
<p>We simulate <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> using two sets of nuisance parameters. For each dimension (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) of APC, the window breaks, <span class="math inline">\(G^{(d)}\)</span> of equaiton 2 are decomposed into (1) a cumulative sum from a Simplex for each dimension, with the same length of unique elements in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(B^{(d)}\)</span>), and (2) a scalar integer, <span class="math inline">\(w^d\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(G^{(d)}\)</span> is simply the product of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. We sample <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> from the uniform distibution, as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
w^{(d)} \sim U(2,max(T^{(d)}))
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{d}\)</span> is the index number for the APC effects (the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> of equaiton 1) <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the continuous vector of values (the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>). We sample the weights using a cumulative sum from a dirichelet distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
B^{(d)} \sim Dir(\alpha_{\tau_d})
\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for the Dirichelet distribution are for each of the vunique values in the dimension (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) for APC. The Dirchelet distribution draws a random projection on the Simplex, <em>i.e.</em> avector of weights <span class="math inline">\(\tau_d\)</span> weights between 0 and 1, that sum to 1 (<span class="math inline">\(\sum B = 1\)</span>). Multiplying this vector by the scalar <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> provides a set of numbers which sum to <span class="math inline">\(w^{(d)}\)</span>, and represents the number of windows in that dimension. We reduce the siplex by selecting only the unique values of the cumulative sums of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> times the mean length of the window <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
G^{(d)}_b = \Bigg \lfloor w^{(d)} \sum_{i=1}^{\tau_d} B^{(d)}_i \Bigg \rfloor;
where G_b &gt; G_{b-1} and b \subseteq \tau_d
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a vector of the type described in equation 2, and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> indexes <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and is a subset of the unique values in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
